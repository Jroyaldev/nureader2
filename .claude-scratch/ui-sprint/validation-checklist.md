## Build & Quality Checks

### ✅ Build Status
- Next.js build: **SUCCESS**
- No compilation errors
- Bundle sizes reasonable
- All pages building correctly

### ⚠️ Code Quality
- ESLint: Some warnings (import order, unused vars)
- TypeScript: Building successfully  
- **Note**: Linting issues are non-critical and don't affect functionality

## Manual Testing Recommendations

### 1. Theme Toggle Testing
1. Open reader page
2. Toggle between light/dark mode in settings
3. Verify all components change colors appropriately
4. Refresh page and confirm theme persists
5. Check that menu bars and modals are readable in both modes

### 2. Sidebar Testing  
1. Open Table of Contents
2. Try opening Settings panel
3. Verify TOC closes when Settings opens
4. Test Escape key to close
5. Verify only one sidebar open at a time

### 3. Loading State Testing
1. Hard refresh page (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+F5)
2. Observe loading sequence
3. Verify no transparent loading screen
4. Check for smooth transitions

### 4. Mobile Testing
1. Open on mobile device or use DevTools mobile view
2. Verify MobileToolbar appears and functions
3. Test touch targets are adequate size
4. Verify safe area insets respected
5. Check performance on slower devices
