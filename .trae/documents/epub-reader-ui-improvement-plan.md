# EPUB Reader UI/UX Improvement Plan

## 1. Product Overview

Transform the current utilitarian EPUB reader into an elegant, premium reading experience with sophisticated visual design and refined interactions. The goal is to achieve "faux-minimalism" - thoughtful, elegant modern minimalism that feels premium and sophisticated rather than stark or bare.

* Replace the current ugly gray glass bars with seamless, contextual UI elements that enhance rather than distract from the reading experience

* Create a cohesive visual hierarchy with improved typography, spacing, and interactive elements that feel premium and modern
