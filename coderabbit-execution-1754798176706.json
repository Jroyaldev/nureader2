I can see:\n\n- Standard Next.js app structure with `/app` directory (App Router)\n- Component library with UI components\n- Authentication and Supabase integration\n- Reading features like annotations, progress tracking\n- No malicious files detected\n\nThe structure matches the CLAUDE.md description of \"Arcadia Reader - A feature-complete, modern EPUB reader\".\n"
