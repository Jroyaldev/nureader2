# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The EPUB Reader application is currently in a semi-functional state with several critical issues that prevent it from being production-ready. This feature aims to systematically identify and resolve all major issues, improve code quality, enhance user experience, and establish proper development practices to bring the application to a professional, production-ready standard.

The application currently has a solid foundation with Next.js, Supabase integration, and basic EPUB reading functionality, but suffers from code quality issues, incomplete features, inconsistent UI/UX, performance problems, and lack of proper error handling and testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Quality and Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this application, I want clean, well-structured, and maintainable code so that I can easily understand, modify, and extend the application without introducing bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all components SHALL follow consistent coding patterns and conventions
2. WHEN examining file structure THEN the project SHALL have a logical, scalable organization with clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN reading any code file THEN it SHALL have proper TypeScript types, interfaces, and error handling
4. WHEN looking at component files THEN they SHALL be properly documented with clear prop interfaces and JSDoc comments
5. WHEN examining utility functions THEN they SHALL be pure, testable, and reusable across the application
6. WHEN reviewing state management THEN it SHALL use consistent patterns and avoid prop drilling
7. WHEN checking for code duplication THEN there SHALL be minimal repetition with shared utilities and components

### Requirement 2: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user of the EPUB reader, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback so that I understand what went wrong and how to resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an EPUB file fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with suggested solutions
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and show appropriate loading states
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with a clear explanation
4. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL show specific error details and allow retry
5. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality and cache data locally
6. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught by error boundaries and logged appropriately
7. WHEN invalid user input is provided THEN the system SHALL validate and show helpful error messages

### Requirement 3: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a reader, I want the application to load quickly, respond smoothly to interactions, and provide a seamless reading experience so that I can focus on the content without technical distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the application THEN it SHALL load the initial page in under 2 seconds
2. WHEN loading an EPUB file THEN it SHALL show progress indicators and complete within 5 seconds for typical files
3. WHEN scrolling through content THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive with smooth 60fps scrolling
4. WHEN switching between pages or chapters THEN transitions SHALL be instantaneous with proper loading states
5. WHEN using the application on mobile devices THEN it SHALL be fully responsive and touch-optimized
6. WHEN images are loading THEN they SHALL not cause layout shifts or block content rendering
7. WHEN the application is idle THEN it SHALL minimize resource usage and battery consumption

### Requirement 4: Feature Completeness and Polish

**User Story:** As a reader, I want all advertised features to work reliably and intuitively so that I can fully utilize the application's capabilities without encountering broken or incomplete functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the annotation system THEN I SHALL be able to create, edit, delete, and navigate between highlights, notes, and bookmarks
2. WHEN accessing the library THEN I SHALL see all my books with proper metadata, covers, and reading progress
3. WHEN using the table of contents THEN I SHALL be able to navigate to any chapter or section accurately
4. WHEN adjusting reading settings THEN changes to theme, font size, and layout SHALL persist across sessions
5. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN all navigation and reading controls SHALL work consistently
6. WHEN accessing the application offline THEN previously loaded content SHALL remain available
7. WHEN syncing across devices THEN reading progress and annotations SHALL be consistent and up-to-date

### Requirement 5: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage and automated quality checks so that I can confidently deploy changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN it SHALL have at least 80% code coverage across all critical paths
2. WHEN components are tested THEN they SHALL have unit tests covering all props, states, and user interactions
3. WHEN API endpoints are tested THEN they SHALL have integration tests covering success and error scenarios
4. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL pass all linting, type checking, and formatting rules
5. WHEN deploying changes THEN automated tests SHALL run and prevent deployment of failing code
6. WHEN testing user flows THEN end-to-end tests SHALL cover critical user journeys
7. WHEN performance is measured THEN automated tests SHALL verify loading times and resource usage

### Requirement 6: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal data, reading history, and uploaded files to be secure and private so that I can trust the application with my personal information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading EPUB files THEN they SHALL be stored securely with proper access controls
2. WHEN user data is transmitted THEN it SHALL use HTTPS and proper encryption
3. WHEN accessing user data THEN proper authentication and authorization SHALL be enforced
4. WHEN handling file uploads THEN malicious files SHALL be detected and rejected
5. WHEN storing user preferences THEN sensitive data SHALL be encrypted at rest
6. WHEN users delete their account THEN all associated data SHALL be completely removed
7. WHEN security vulnerabilities are discovered THEN they SHALL be patched within 24 hours

### Requirement 7: Deployment and DevOps

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable deployment processes and monitoring so that I can maintain the application in production with confidence and quickly respond to issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN it SHALL use automated CI/CD pipelines with proper testing gates
2. WHEN the application is running in production THEN it SHALL have comprehensive monitoring and alerting
3. WHEN errors occur in production THEN they SHALL be automatically logged and reported
4. WHEN deploying updates THEN there SHALL be zero-downtime deployment with rollback capabilities
5. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the application SHALL support horizontal scaling and load balancing
6. WHEN backups are needed THEN database and file storage SHALL be automatically backed up daily
7. WHEN performance issues arise THEN monitoring SHALL provide detailed metrics and profiling data
