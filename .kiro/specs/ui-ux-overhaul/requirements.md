# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The EPUB Reader application currently has a solid foundation with functional components and a basic design system, but requires a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul to achieve a truly polished, production-ready experience. While the existing design shows good aesthetic direction with Apple-inspired elements, the implementation needs systematic refinement across all pages and components to ensure consistency, accessibility, and exceptional user experience on both web and mobile platforms.

The current application demonstrates good foundational choices but suffers from inconsistent component implementations, incomplete responsive design, accessibility gaps, and lacks the refined polish expected in modern applications. This overhaul will transform the interface into a cohesive, beautiful, and highly functional reading experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Design System Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer and designer, I want a complete, consistent design system implemented across all components so that the application has a unified visual language and maintainable codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any component THEN it SHALL follow consistent design tokens for spacing, typography, colors, and interactions
2. WHEN using components THEN they SHALL have standardized props interfaces and consistent behavior patterns
3. WHEN viewing the application THEN all visual elements SHALL use the same border radius, shadow, and animation systems
4. WHEN interacting with buttons, inputs, and controls THEN they SHALL have consistent hover, focus, and active states
5. WHEN switching between light and dark themes THEN all components SHALL transition smoothly with proper contrast ratios
6. WHEN examining component code THEN each SHALL be properly documented with TypeScript interfaces and usage examples
7. WHEN building new features THEN developers SHALL have access to a complete component library with clear guidelines

### Requirement 2: Mobile-First Responsive Design Excellence

**User Story:** As a user accessing the application on any device, I want a flawless responsive experience that adapts beautifully to my screen size and input method so that I can use all features comfortably regardless of device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application on mobile devices THEN all interfaces SHALL be touch-optimized with appropriate target sizes
2. WHEN viewing on tablets THEN the layout SHALL adapt to utilize the available space effectively
3. WHEN using on desktop THEN the interface SHALL take advantage of larger screens with contextual controls
4. WHEN rotating mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt smoothly to orientation changes
5. WHEN navigating on mobile THEN touch gestures SHALL work intuitively for reading and navigation
6. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible and properly focused
7. WHEN testing across devices THEN the experience SHALL be consistent and optimized for each form factor

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Reading Experience Design

**User Story:** As a reader, I want a beautifully designed, distraction-free reading interface that enhances my focus and enjoyment of books so that I can immerse myself completely in the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading a book THEN the interface controls SHALL fade away to minimize distractions
2. WHEN hovering or tapping THEN contextual controls SHALL appear smoothly with elegant animations
3. WHEN adjusting reading settings THEN changes SHALL be applied immediately with smooth transitions
4. WHEN viewing the reader THEN typography SHALL be optimized for readability with proper line height and spacing
5. WHEN using dark mode THEN the reading experience SHALL be comfortable with appropriate contrast
6. WHEN navigating chapters THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and maintain reading context
7. WHEN annotating text THEN the interface SHALL provide intuitive tools without disrupting the reading flow

### Requirement 4: Library and Navigation Excellence

**User Story:** As a user managing my book collection, I want an elegant, efficient library interface that makes it easy to find, organize, and access my books so that I can focus on reading rather than managing files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing my library THEN books SHALL be displayed in an attractive, scannable grid layout
2. WHEN searching for books THEN the interface SHALL provide fast, intuitive search with visual feedback
3. WHEN organizing books THEN I SHALL have access to collections, tags, and sorting options
4. WHEN uploading books THEN the process SHALL be smooth with clear progress indicators and error handling
5. WHEN viewing book details THEN information SHALL be presented clearly with editing capabilities
6. WHEN browsing on mobile THEN the library SHALL adapt to smaller screens while maintaining usability
7. WHEN managing large collections THEN the interface SHALL perform smoothly with virtual scrolling and lazy loading

### Requirement 5: Accessibility and Inclusive Design

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the application to be fully accessible with proper keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and customizable display options so that I can use all features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be reachable and properly focused
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all content and controls SHALL be properly labeled and announced
3. WHEN adjusting display settings THEN I SHALL have options for font size, contrast, and motion preferences
4. WHEN navigating the interface THEN focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible and well-designed
5. WHEN using assistive technologies THEN all functionality SHALL remain available and usable
6. WHEN encountering errors THEN messages SHALL be clearly communicated to all users
7. WHEN testing with accessibility tools THEN the application SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Requirement 6: Performance and Polish

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to feel fast, smooth, and polished in every interaction so that the experience feels premium and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading pages THEN initial render SHALL occur within 1 second with smooth loading states
2. WHEN interacting with components THEN animations SHALL be smooth at 60fps with appropriate easing
3. WHEN switching themes THEN transitions SHALL be seamless without visual glitches
4. WHEN scrolling through content THEN performance SHALL remain smooth even with large libraries
5. WHEN using touch interactions THEN responses SHALL be immediate with appropriate haptic feedback
6. WHEN loading images THEN they SHALL appear progressively without layout shifts
7. WHEN experiencing slow networks THEN the interface SHALL degrade gracefully with offline capabilities

### Requirement 7: Component Library and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer working on the application, I want a comprehensive component library with clear documentation so that I can build features efficiently and maintain consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building features THEN I SHALL have access to a complete set of reusable components
2. WHEN using components THEN each SHALL have clear TypeScript interfaces and prop documentation
3. WHEN examining components THEN they SHALL include usage examples and best practices

5. WHEN styling components THEN they SHALL use consistent design tokens and CSS variables
6. WHEN extending components THEN the architecture SHALL support customization without breaking consistency
7. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the component library SHALL serve as clear implementation guidance
